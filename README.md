## Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently doing my master's in Computer Science at the University of Freiburg
- 🌱 I’m (trying to) learn and explore more about Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend AI with real-world applications
- 💬 Ask me about anything tech or bookish — I'm always eager to dive in and learn, even if I don't have all the answers.
